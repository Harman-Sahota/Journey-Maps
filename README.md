# Journey Maps

## Overview

Journey Maps is a groundbreaking mental health platform designed to provide users with comprehensive tools for self-discovery, community support, and personalized guidance. Our mission is to empower individuals on their mental health journey by offering a range of features tailored to their needs.

## Early Plans

### Mental Health Journaling
The cornerstone of our platform is our intuitive journaling feature. Users can document their thoughts, feelings, and progress over time, enabling deeper self-reflection and understanding.

### Symptom Matching
We aim to foster a sense of community and empathy by connecting users with similar symptoms. Through this feature, individuals can find support from others who share their struggles.

### Integration with Discord
To facilitate seamless communication and support, we've integrated with Discord. Users can join a dedicated server associated with the app, providing a hub for community engagement and discussions.

### Data Collection and Analysis
We're committed to improving our platform through data-driven insights. By collecting anonymized data from user journal entries and symptom input, we can identify trends and patterns to enhance our features.

## Main Plans Down the Line

### Personalized Journey Maps
As our dataset grows, we'll introduce personalized journey maps that visualize potential pathways to positive outcomes. These maps will provide tailored guidance based on aggregated user experiences.

### Expanded Community Features
We'll continue to enhance our community features, offering discussion forums, support groups, and peer mentoring programs. Our goal is to create a supportive environment where users can connect and share resources.

### Integration with Mental Health Resources
To provide comprehensive support, we'll integrate with external mental health resources such as therapy directories and crisis hotlines. Users can access these resources directly from the app to supplement their journey.

### Continuous Improvement and Iteration
We're committed to continuous improvement, prioritizing user feedback and industry best practices. Regular updates and enhancements will ensure that our platform remains effective and user-friendly.
